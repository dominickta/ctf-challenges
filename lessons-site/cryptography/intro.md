# Introduction to Modern Cryptography
Modern cryptograhy is one of the most important aspects of computer and communications security.
It is the backbone for securing banks, companies, governments, websites, and more.

## Primary Goals of Modern Cryptography

### Confidentiality
- If someone looks at a message, they will not be able to understand the message.

### Integrity
- If someone modifies our data, we will be able to detect it.

### Authentication
- We can be sure that whoever we are talking to is who they say they are.

## Modern vs Classical Cryptography

Classical cryptography operates on traditional characters that you would see in
your day-to-day life. Modern cryptography operates on the language of computers:
binary bit sequences.
