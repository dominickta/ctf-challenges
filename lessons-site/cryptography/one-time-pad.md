# One Time Pad Encryption

One type of symmetric encryption is the One Time Pad. The One Time Pad works by taking a key that is as long as the text you want to encrypt and then performing the XOR operation to get the encrypted text. The same key used to encrypt the text is also used in decrypting, by performing the XOR operation with the encrypted text and the key. To summarize encryptedMSG = MSG XOR Key and MSG = encryptedMSG XOR Key. XORing is a cheap operation so it is easy to encrypt and decrypt messages which is an advantage of the One Time Pad
