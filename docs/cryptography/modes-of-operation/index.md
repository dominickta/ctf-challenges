# Modes of Operation
Block ciphers need to be combined with a ‘mode of operation’ to work. A mode of operation determines how a block cipher will be applied to multiple blocks in a row. A block cipher by itself would only be able to work on a single block of plaintext, which isn’t useful because a message will be split up into multiple blocks.
